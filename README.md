# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Setting up the Project Locally

1. Clone the Repository: Clone the repository by entering the following command in your terminal or by simply downloading the zip file from github.

 git clone https://github.com/Nayan1509/Personal-Bookshelf.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory: Once cloned the file open it in visual studio code or any IDE and navigate to the direcotory using "cd" command

 cd Personal-Bookshelf

3. Install Dependencies: Install the dependencies, node modules
  
   npm install

This project has been set up locally and is ready to run on local machine.

#### Running the Application Locally

Once you have set up the project, you can run the application on your local machine with the following steps:

1. Start the Development Server: start the developement server using npm command.
  npm start

2. Open the Application in Your Browser:
  Once the development server starts, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or another port if specified).

3. Interact with the Application:
  You can now interact with the application in your browser. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the home page of the application.

#### Additional Notes
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before setting up the project.
Make sure that the necessary environment variables or configuration files (if any) are properly set up before running the application.
